1. Overview

grbcatalog.org is an open source web application dedicated to 
Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) studies. The data and the source code are 
freely available in this repository for anyone to either contribute 
or install at their own institution. The aim of the grbcatalog.org 
project is to catalog all GRBs detected by various instruments and 
build an online platform that GRB researches can quickly analyze 
published data without having to painfully collect them from 
published papers.

The grbcatalog.org features web based data analysis tools that 
can be used by anyone with a web browser. These tools can create 
publication quality plots for GRB researchers. System is written 
in python based web application framework called django 
(https://www.djangoproject.com/). In addition, it uses python 
plotting library matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/) to create 
publication quality plots. The recommended database backend is 
MySql (http://www.mysql.com/) but user may use any database 
management system supported by django. 

2.Description

The basic philosophy behind the design of grbcatalog.org web 
application is to limit client side requirements to minimum. 
Thereby allowing users with wide variety of devices to access 
and use the web application. There can be multiple instances 
of the web application so if one server is not working people 
can use other available servers.
